# Banking-system-project
 Hi, I’m Neeraj.
👀 I like to develop new things and want to sharpen my coding skills....

🌱 I made this project to revise c++ concepts and to be more than good in loops and statements.

💞️ Key concepts used in this project was: OOP, file handling, loops. and conditions.

📫 It was a challenge to make a good data structure to hold user's data to perform various operations easily.
