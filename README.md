# Banking-system-project
 Hi, I’m Neeraj.
👀 I like to develop new things and want to sharpen my coding skills....

🌱 I made this project to revise c++ concepts and to be more than good in loops and statements.

-->> This repository contains 4-main files:

     1-  (.cpp) source code file.

     1-  (.exe) file.

     1-  (database.txt) which stores user's data.

     1-  (transaction_database.txt) which store transactions of users.

💞️ Key concepts used in this project was: OOP, file handling, loops. and conditions.

📫 It was a challenge to make a good data structure to hold user's data to perform various operations easily.
